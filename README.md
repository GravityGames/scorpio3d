# Scorpio 3D
Well, here it is, Scorpio 3D, my WIP, one time proprietary 3D Game Engine.
Don't be fooled by the name, Scorpio 3D was redesigned from the ground up after I realised that the original 
Scorpio was really poorly designed. That version was silently scrapped, and hopefully I can use the knowledge 
I learned to avoid the same happening to this one.
