# scorpio3d
Well, here it is, Scorpio 3D, my WIP, one time proprietary 3D Game Engine.
Don't be fooled by the name, Scorpio 3D was redesigned from the ground up after I realised that the original 
Scorpio was really poorly designed. That version was silently scrapped, and hopefully I can use the knowledge 
I learned to avoid the same happening to this one.

The initial commit will be once I decide upon a license.
